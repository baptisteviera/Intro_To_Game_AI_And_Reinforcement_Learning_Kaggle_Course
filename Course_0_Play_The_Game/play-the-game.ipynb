Each player uses a different color (usually red or yellow), and the objective of the game is to be the first player to get four discs in a row.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/40B1MGc.png\"><br/>\n</center>\n\nIn this course, you will build your own intelligent agents to play the game.\n- In the first lesson, you'll learn how to set up the game environment and create your first agent.\n- The next two lessons focus on traditional methods for building game AI.  These agents will be smart enough to defeat many novice players!\n- In the final lesson, you'll experiment with cutting-edge algorithms from the field of reinforcement learning.  The agents that you build will come up with gameplay strategies much like humans do: gradually, and with experience. \n\n# Join the competition\n\nThroughout the course, you'll test your agents' performance by competing against agents that other users have created.  \n\nTo join the competition, open a new window with **[the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/overview)**, and click on the **\"Join Competition\"** button.
